Hello

{!Onboarding__c.Account__c}â€™s FD Analytic view has been built. Goals were imported into their Ads account on {!Onboarding__c.Import_Goals_from_FD_View_to_Google_Ads__c}. 

{!Onboarding__c.Regional_performance_manager__c}, please verify goals at launch and update the Goals Object in Salesforce.

Thank you,
